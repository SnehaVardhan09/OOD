1 Object-oriented Design

- design is often considered as step done before programming
- This is'nt true; in reality, analysis, programmming and design tend to overlap, combine and interweave.
 
1.1 Intro OO
- Object: tangible thing that we can sense, feel and manipulate.
- Software obj are models of something that can do certain things and have certain things done to them
- Object is collection of data and associated behaviors
- Oriented is directed towards

Object oriented analysis (OOA) - WHAT
- process of looking at problem and identifying the objects and interaction between those objects.

I need a website,into a set of requirements. For example:
Website visitors need to be able to (" " represents actions, ' ' represents objects):
• "review" our 'history'
• "apply" for 'jobs'
• "browse, compare, and order" 'products'

Object-oriented design (OOD) - HOW
- Convert requirments into an implementation specification
- name of objects, define the behaviour, and formally specify which obj can activate specific behaviour on the other objects.

Object oriented programming (OOP) 
- design in to a working program
- No matter how hard we try to separate these stages, we'll always find things that need further analysis while we're designing. 
   When we're programming, we find features that need clarification in the design.
- Iterative development 

1.2 Objects and classes

- we can assume that apples go in barrels and oranges go in baskets.
  Now, we have four kinds of objects: apples, oranges, baskets, and barrels.
  In object-oriented modeling, the term used for 'kind of object' is class. So, in technical terms, we now have four classes of objects.

- What's the difference between an object and a class? Classes describe objects.
- The relationship between the four classes of objects in our inventory system can be described using a Unified Modeling Language
                    Orange ----- Baskets
                    Apple  ----- Barrel

1.3 Speci attributes and behaviors:

Specific object can gave different data values for the given characterstics (attributes)
